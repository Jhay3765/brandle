# A brand Guessing Game

Brandle is a web-based guessing game built with **React**.

1. You’re shown hints about a famous brand (text + logos).
2. You have **3 guesses**.
3. Guess correctly → 🎉 see the win screen.
4. Run out of guesses → ❌ lose screen with the answer.
5. Keep playing — rounds are **infinite**, randomly pulled from a pool of brands.
